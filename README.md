`helium-python` is a Python package for building applications with the Helium API. [Helium](https://www.helium.com) is an integrated platform of smart sensors, communication, edge-compute and API that enables numerous sensing applications. For more information about the underlying REST API, check out the complete [Helium documentation](https://docs.helium.com).

## Installation

Assuming you're using `pip`, add this line to your `setup.py`:

```
requires = ['helium-python']
```

or to your `requirements.txt` file:

```
helium-python
```

## Usage and Documentation 


Please check out the [helium-python documentation on Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/helium-python) for the latest examples and complete reference.


## Development


In order to develop for helium-python you will need to install tox:

```
pip install tox
```

Since `helium-python` supports at least Python 2.7 and 3.5 you will need to have at least one of those installed on your development machine. The build automation will test all required versions when code is pushed to this repository.

Clone this repository and run:

```
$ tox
```

This will install the required packages and run the tests for the library. Installing `tox` removes the need to install or use `virtualenv` since tox manages virtual environments already.

By default the tests will replay back previously recorded API interactions. To affect how tests interact with the Helium API you will have to

* Set a `HELIUM_API_KEY` environment variable to a valid Helium API key. For example in `bash`:


```
$ export HELIUM_API_KEY=<my api key>
```

* Set `HELIUM_RECORD_MODE` to one of:

**none** - (default) Only play back recorded API interactions.

**once** - Only record interactions for which no recording exist. If you get an error message from betamax complaining about a recording not matching an interaction that means that your test has new API interactions with it. Remove the cassette referred to in the error message and run the test again to re-generate it .

We use `flake8` to ensure we catch Python version differences and common pitfalls quicker. Please run:

```
$ tox -e lint
```

before you commit code and try to remove as many warnings as you can. Once we figure out how strict some of the documentation requirements need to be we will be running lint as part of automation.

In order to develop documentation you can run::

```
$ tox -e docs html
```

or to see your documentation changes live:

```
$ tox -e docs livehtml
```

To make a release tag the repository with a valid [semantic version](https://semver.org) version and push tags. The build automation will automatically build and push releases to [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org).
